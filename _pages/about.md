I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at **Purdue University**, advised by Prof. Kaushik Roy in the [Nanoelectronics Research Laboratory (NRL)](https://engineering.purdue.edu/NRL){:target="_blank"}. My research lies at the intersection of **brain-inspired computing** and **energy-efficient AI**, where I explore how insights from neuroscience can help design learning algorithms that are scalable, local, and hardware-friendly.

Broadly, I work on **hardware/software co-design** for **neuromorphic and edge AI systems**, developing methods that enable models to learn continuously and adapt on-device with minimal energy and memory cost. My recent work includes local learning rules for deep and spiking neural networks, continual learning frameworks, and low-rank adaptive compression techniques for efficient fine-tuning.

I received my B.Sc. in Electronics Engineering from the National University of Engineering (UNI), Peru, in 2017. My path has included research experiences at Texas Instruments - Kilby Labs, the Jicamarca Radio Observatory, and INICTEL-UNI. I am a recipient of the **Beca Presidente de la Rep√∫blica (PRONABEC)** fellowship and the **NSF AccelNet NeuroPAC Fellowship**, supporting international research on neuromorphic learning hardware at TU Delft.
