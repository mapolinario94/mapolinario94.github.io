    - title: Graduate Research Assistant
      institution: Purdue University - Center for Brain-Inspired Computing (C-BRIC), West Lafayette, Indiana, US
      year: 2021 - Present
      description:
        - Conduct research on neuro-inspired machine learning algorithms for emerging hardware technologies, with emphasis on scalability and energy efficiency in neuromorphic systems.
        - Developed CODE-CL, a continual learning framework using conceptor-based gradient projection, enabling knowledge retention and forward transfer in sequential tasks.
        - Designed an ADC-less in-memory computing hardware for Spiking Neural Networks, achieving 2–7× energy savings and 9–24× latency reduction over conventional architectures through HW/SW co-design.
        - Proposed novel spatial, temporal, and fully local learning rules (LLS, S-TLLR, TESS), inspired by biologically plausible mechanisms such as STDP, synchronization, and eligibility traces; matched backpropagation performance at significantly lower computational cost.
