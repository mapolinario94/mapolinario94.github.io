I had an amazing time presenting my work at the [IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2025](https://wacv2025.thecvf.com/){:target="\_blank"}! I showcased our research on **LLS: Local Learning Rule for Deep Neural Networks Inspired by Neural Activity Synchronization**.

This work introduces a novel bio-inspired local learning rule that enables training deep networks without relying on backpropagation. By leveraging synchronization mechanisms observed in biological neurons, **LLS** and its variants (**LLS-M** and **LLS-MxM**) achieve competitive accuracy with up to **300× fewer MAC operations** and significantly lower memory requirements—making them well-suited for **on-device and edge AI applications**.

It was a great opportunity to connect with researchers pushing the boundaries of efficient learning and edge intelligence.

A heartfelt thank you to my co-authors, **Arani Roy** and **Prof. Kaushik Roy**, to the **Nanoelectronics Research Laboratory (NRL)** at Purdue University, and **Center for the Co-Design of Cognitive Systems (CoCoSys)** for their incredible support throughout this project.
